What's SciUnit and how to install it?
=====================================

Everyone hopes that their model has some correspondence with reality. 
Usually, checking whether this is true is done informally. But SciUnit makes this formal and transparent.

SciUnit is a framework for validating scientific models by creating experimental-data-driven unit tests.
